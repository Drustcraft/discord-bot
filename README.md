[Drustcraft](https://www.drustcraft.com.au) is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) community that not only enables players to play in a large open MMORPG, but also gives the tools to create their own towns, quests, shops, NPCs, participate in world events, dungeons and raids through story-telling, design and coding.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a free-play, safe and open world for players to explore and expand on, directing the storyline towards their work. There is even options for organisations to join in and create their own townships, quests and engagements!
